## Simple IO test

* use of cudaMalloc and cudaMemcpy to test transfer from CPU to GPU
* getting slope t = 8.55e-10 s/bytes -> 1s correspond to  1,14 GB (linear increase)

## Advanced IO test

### Pinned Host memory

* GPU cannot access data directly from pageable host memory
* When transferring data, CUDA must first allocate a temporary page-locked or pinned host array
* Then, pinned array to device memory is performed
